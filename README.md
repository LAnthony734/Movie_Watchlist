This project was an exercise in C89 file I/O and linked lists. The program reads a movie library text file (library.txt) and provides the user commands for manipulated a movie watchlist. The format of this library file as seen in library.txt must be followed for additional libraries. Once completed, the watchlist can be written to a new text file.
